**Chapter:** 7 — *The Rope Kernel Trick* (up to SVMs)

---

## ✅ What I Did
- Read the first part of **Chapter 7** of *Why Machines Learn*  
- Focused on the intuition and foundations behind **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**  
- Explored how SVMs separate data and where the concept of **kernels** fits in  

---

## 💡 What I Learned
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** aim to find the **best separating hyperplane** that maximizes the margin between classes  
- The **margin** is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class — called **support vectors**  
- A larger margin often means better generalization to unseen data  
- SVMs work well even in **high-dimensional spaces** and are robust to overfitting  
- When data is **not linearly separable**, SVMs use a **"kernel trick"** to implicitly map data to higher dimensions without explicitly computing the transformation  
- This allows linear separation in that transformed space, even if it looks nonlinear in the original space  
- The name *“The Rope Kernel Trick”* is a metaphor — imagine untangling data by lifting it into higher dimensions, like lifting tangled ropes off a table

## 🧠 Concepts To Revisit
- Why maximizing the margin leads to better generalization  
- How **support vectors** determine the final decision boundary  
- Mathematical intuition behind the **kernel trick**  
- Different types of **kernels** (linear, polynomial, RBF) and when to use them

## ⏭️ What's Next
- Continue **Chapter 7** to go deeper into the **kernel trick** and explore **nonlinear decision boundaries**  
- Learn how SVMs remain powerful by avoiding the curse of dimensionality through kernel functions
