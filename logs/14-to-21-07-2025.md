---

## ‚úÖ What I Did
- Read **Chapter 8** of *Why Machines Learn*  
- Explored how ideas from **physics** have influenced the development of **machine learning** algorithms  
- Focused on the connection between **energy minimization** and learning in neural networks  

---

## üí° What I Learned
- Physics, especially concepts from **statistical mechanics**, has played a key role in shaping how machines learn  
- Many ML algorithms can be viewed as trying to **minimize an energy function**, similar to how physical systems seek low-energy (stable) states  
- The chapter draws parallels between **learning algorithms** and **physical systems**, such as particles settling into equilibrium  
- Introduced the idea of **Hopfield networks**, which use energy-based formulations to store and retrieve patterns ‚Äî inspired by physics models  
- Learning in such systems involves finding **low-energy configurations** that correspond to **stable memory states**  
- These insights have influenced the development of modern deep learning techniques like **energy-based models** and **Boltzmann machines**

## üß† Concepts To Revisit
- How **energy functions** are defined in the context of machine learning  
- Mathematical intuition behind **Hopfield networks** and their dynamics  
- Role of **Boltzmann distribution** in probabilistic learning  
- Connections between **gradient descent** and physical relaxation processes

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next
- Begin **Chapter 9** to explore how **deep learning** architectures evolved  
- Understand how layered models build hierarchical representations of data  
- Dive into modern neural networks and the rise of **backpropagation** in complex systems
