# 🧠 AI Mastery Journey (2025–2027)

Hi! I'm documenting my daily progress as I master AI, ML, Deep Learning, and build real-world projects.

This repository is my **public learning journal**, where I post:
- ✅ Daily/weekly logs
- 📊 Code & notebooks for each major project
- 🛠️ Tools I learn
- 📚 Notes from courses, books, and experiments

---

## 📅 Start Date
**2025-07-01**

## 🎯 Goal
To master Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning deeply enough to build, deploy, and monetize real-world AI applications — and ultimately launch my own AI-powered startup.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
/logs/                  ← Daily/Weekly learning logs (in Markdown)
/ml-projects/           ← Supervised/Unsupervised ML projects
/deep-learning/         ← CNNs, RNNs, transformers, etc.
/deployment/            ← FastAPI, Docker, cloud deployment examples
/resources/             ← Cheat sheets, book notes, curated lists
```

## 🧾 Sample Log Format

Each log is stored under `/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

```markdown
# 2025-07-01

## ✅ What I Did
- Watched CNN lesson from DeepLearning.AI
- Trained MNIST CNN model (97.2% accuracy)

## 💡 What I Learned
- How padding and stride affect feature maps
- Role of dropout in preventing overfitting

## 🧠 Concepts To Revisit
- Backpropagation through convolution layers

## ⏭️ What's Next
- Visualize CNN filters using matplotlib
- Try using batch normalization
```
